/*
 * Different table layout algorithm can resize the table width based on the
 * content or the column width.
 *
 * auto: Automatic table layout algorithm (this is default):
 *       The column width is set by the widest unbreakable content in the cells
 *       Can be slow, since it needs to read through all the content in the
 *       table, before determining the final layout
 *
 * fixed: Fixed table layout algorithm:
 *       The horizontal layout only depends on the table's width and the width
 *       of the columns, not the contents of the cells Allows a browser to lay
 *       out the table faster than the automatic table layout The browser can
 *       begin to display the table once the first row has been received
